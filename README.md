# CUDA-filters
This project allows to apply low-pass and high-pass filters on ".bmp" images using CUDA to perform calculations on GPU.

In order to run the project place ".bmp" image in the project folder as "image.bmp". As a result you will get four images with applied previously mentioned filters.
